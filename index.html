                            Developed, hosted, and deployed two websites, a personal resume site and a photography portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                            Made extensive customizations and optimizations to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code using Visual Studio Code, ensuring responsive design and seamless user experience.
                            Managed hosting via Amazon S3, configuring bucket policies and permissions to ensure secure public access.
                            Implemented CloudFront distribution for enhanced security and performance, enabling HTTPS support through AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
                            Configured CloudFront invalidation to ensure rapid content updates across the CDN.
                            Managed DNS by purchasing a custom domain and configuring it in Route 53, setting up alias records to point to the CloudFront distribution.
                            Set up Server Access Logging for both S3 buckets and monitored activity using CloudWatch for enhanced security and tracking.
                            A view counter feature was implemented using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB to track visitor interactions on the resume site.
                            A DynamoDB table was created to store the view count, and an AWS Lambda function increments this count each time the page is loaded.
                            The website's JavaScript code makes an AJAX call to the Lambda function, dynamically updating the displayed view count for users.</p>

                            Developed a single-player quiz game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring 50 questions, and hosted it on Amazon S3. Set up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS services to automate the build and deployment process. Uploaded the project files to a GitHub repository, which serves as the source for AWS CodePipeline. Configured CodePipeline to trigger automatically on every commit to the repository, ensuring continuous integration. Used AWS CodeBuild to compile, test, and package the source code, defined with a buildspec.yml file for precise control over build steps. Configured the build output as artifacts and linked them to an S3 bucket, where the final deployment takes place. Integrated Amazon CloudFront as a CDN to enhance the website's performance and security, and configured a custom domain using AWS Route 53 for seamless access. This setup ensures that any changes made to the GitHub repository are automatically tested, built, and deployed to the live site, providing a streamlined and reliable workflow.
